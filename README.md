# "Parallel devleopmental changes in children's production and recognition of line drawings of visual concepts" 

This repository is designed to share the data, code, and figures that support the above paper. 

## Overview
The repository is organized into the following sections:

*Data* - Contains both raw and preprocessed data for generating the anlayses.
Inside "Data", there are several notable folders:

Figures_out - contains the pdfs of the figures in the paper
Figures_csv - contains the preprocessed data for each figure
Drawings - contains .zip files with the pngs of the drawings
CSV files with all of the drawings and their stroke information are located in the OSF repository as they are too large to be hosted on GitHub (see link below.)

*Analysis* - Step by step anlaysis files that generate the figures and inferential statistics in the paper, written mostly in R and RMarkdown. At the end of each file are the exact versions of R and associated packages used to generate the figures and data.
HTML files show both the code and the rendered figures.

*Experiments*  - Javascript code for the main experiments listed in the main (production & recognition)


*Model classifications* - Two different models were used to obtain classifications of the drawings in the larger dataset.
